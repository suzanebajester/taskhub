# TaskHub
**TaskHub** is a simple task management app inspired by **Trello**, built only with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps you organize tasks into columns (To Do, Doing, Done), with **drag & drop**, inline editing, and persistent storage via **LocalStorage**.

**Drag & Drop** between columns **and within the same column** (reordering)  
**Column-based border colors** for better visual separation
